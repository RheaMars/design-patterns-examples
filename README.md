# How to implement Design Patterns?

## What's this repo about?

As developers, we frequently encounter design patterns, whether in conversations with colleagues or friends, at
conferences, or in articles, and hopefully, sometimes even in the code we are reading and working on.

I believe I would recognize most design patterns by name, but let's be honest: If someone were to, for example, ask
me, 'Could you provide me with an example implementation of the Strategy pattern right now?' I would probably fail.

So, this repository is dedicated to enhancing our understanding of how to implement the design patterns we often
discuss.

## The structure of this repo

There are three types of Design Patterns: Creational Design Patterns, Behavioral Design Patterns, and Structural Design
Patterns. Therefore, I have decided to organize this repository into three folders, each containing subfolders with a
README file and example code for the patterns within their respective categories.

## Further notes

The examples in this repository draw strong inspiration from https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns. Thank you for
providing this informative website.
